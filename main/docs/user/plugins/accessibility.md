:::caution Android only
This plugin is available only for the **Android version** of the OsmAnd app. The **[iOS Version](#how-to-use-ios)** uses the basic accessibility features of the system.
:::


The Accessibility plugin allows you to use Accessibility Android features that are in your device's system settings directly in the OsmAnd app.  


## Overview  

Makes device accessibility features directly available in OsmAnd. The plugin allows blind and visually impaired people to take full advantage of the OsmAnd app's features. Accessibility plugin makes it easy to set speech speed for text pronunciation, customize navigation, zoom controls, and automatic announcements. [Learn more](https://www.android.com/accessibility/) about Android accessibility features.


### How to use (Android)

For the plugin to work, you need to go to Accessibility from the settings item on the app screen, or go directly through the system settings of the device, and select the required settings. To set individual parameters, [see here](#plugin-settings).  

After enabling the plugin and enabling the Android Accessibility settings for your device, the map's reaction to gestures will be changed. The Android’s TalkBack screen reader will tell you in which situations to apply which gesture. The full **list of TalkBack gestures** can be viewed [here](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6151827?hl=en&ref_topic=10601570#zippy=%2Cother%2Cbasic-navigation). All of the [OsmAnd gestures](../map/interact-with-map#gestures) that are used to interact with the maps built into the app will also be available.
