[3D GPX track](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/tracks/appearance#3d-track) feature adds a new dimension. It not only displays the route's elevation but also offers additional data visualization, including speed, altitude, slope, and heart rate ([sensors data](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/external-sensors#trip-recording)), for example. This comprehensive view helps users analyze their performance and better understand the dynamics of their route in a realistic 3D environment.

When I go on a bike ride, I use OsmAnd to record my track, while my heart rate is monitored through sensor. Throughout the ride, conditions are constantly changing—terrain, road surfaces, and weather all play a role in how the trip unfolds.

After the ride, I can analyze my trip in detail using the [3D track mode](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/tracks/appearance#3d-track). The track is displayed in three dimensions, making it easier to study:
  - 3D track wall height shows my Heart rate changes,
  - 3D track wall color represents the Slope,
  - [track line color](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/tracks/appearance#color) itself reflects my speed.

This detailed view helps me understand how my physical performance and the conditions changed throughout the ride, allowing me to improve my training efficiency and better plan future trips.

OsmAnd allows you to record track data from [various sensors](https://osmand.net/docs/user/plugins/external-sensors#overview), like heart rate, temperature, bicycle power or speed sensors, and then provides the ability to perform comprehensive analysis afterward. You can visualize how different aspects—such as heart rate, speed, and slope—interacted during your ride, all in one detailed 3D track view. It’s a powerful tool for those who want a deeper understanding of their performance and the ride conditions.
